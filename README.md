The **DirichletCorrection** package implements a bias correction for the Dirichlet multivariate regression model, as proposed by Melo et al. (2020). The primary goal of the package is to adjust maximum likelihood estimators to be second-order bias-free, applying the bias correction without increasing mean squared errors. It allows for the estimation of parameters in the Dirichlet model for positive multivariate data that sum to one and includes functions for calculating corrected parameters, the second-order bias vector, and the associated standard errors. The package also offers an implementation of the Corrected Score Function, which adjusts parameter estimation, providing a more accurate analysis. This process is validated through Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the bias correction in improving the performance of the estimators.
